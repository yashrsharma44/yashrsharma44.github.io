## Incentive Driven Development
Well, I wrote this post, after reading a [bunch of books on how randomness and skill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586925-the-success-equation) play a part in our lives. Coupled with the fact, that working in a big-tech company gives a nice opportunity to see the balance of skill/randomness in action, and how you could tie up the events as statistically significant. 

While the books and my motivation, behind this post, are not semantically related at all, it helped me realize, *incentives are one of the key things*, which helps you setup execution, and the metrics associated with it, to understand how well we're progressing.

We always have heard, about things in life, which we aspire to follow - we often feel like, we should follow good habits in life, exercise well, eat well, study well, or whatever. As kids, we often felt the gap behind why we're supposed to do(at-least I felt :P), and with time, we did realise the repurcusions of not doing a thing(fear based motivation), or the perks of doing that.

It is often difficult to motivate yourself for following towards a goal, and we often fall short of the target many times. Having a strong conviction is often not enough, and it means that you fall to your level of execution, rather than your aspirations. It is important to keep aspirations, goals in life, as it is the thing which drives us to change our lives to meet them. Having a north-star is really important, and becomes important to track how well we're doing to reach there.

So whenever you want to achieve a goal, have an incentive behind it, for getting it. Incentives should align with your goals, which helps you direct execution towards it.

## Gamifying things and tracking progress

Gamifying things has been one of the most utopian concepts that we know about. Breaking down the execution into gamified things, helps you measure the success, and ensure that the human mind has a metric to strive to reach. The very act of measuring, tracking and striving execution to improve the metric, is proven to make incremental progress to achieving goals.

We often find it easier to follow along, when we try to gamify things in life. Chores, workouts, tracking calories, tracking steps walked along, etc. all get easier to achieve, if we gamify things. Make sure, you have a higher level north-star to reach, otherwise, the very act of gamification, and metric optimisation becomes a soul-less activity, which makes humans sad.

## When tracking becomes target

You have to be careful to not make the metric the target; we often lose the big-picture, when we go deep into tracking things. Execution by itself becomes the goal, and we look forward to maximising the metric setup, which might be become orthogonal to the very thing it tracks. 

Execution should be strongly tied to the data referring to it. As long the metric which closely represents the data that we are measuring holds true, the execution should be aligned with the metric represented. We can keep tracking the metric and ensure we optimally reach it, however, if the very thing it represents gets modified, we should modify our execution as well.

Consider an example, the blood glucose level was(and it is still) measured by CGMs(continuous glucose monitors), however a gold standard for it, is the HbA1c, which gives more fine-grain data on how glucose progresses. This is a classical example of how the execution(trying to optimize the CGM level) might be an exercise futile if we know that we have a new metric (HbA1c), and try to shift our execution to meet that. 

Need to keep the execution tied to the high-level goal; metrics are the ways to track it, and it can change with time.

## I think observing the outcome and attributing metrics to it, helps us assert the validity of the statistic

How do you assign validity to a statistic, and the metric, if it's a good measure? Why I don't have a
