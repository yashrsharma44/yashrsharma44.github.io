This blog-post summarises my placement season, and my experiences ranging from prepping from interviews, to bagging some of the offers, and in-between managing my expectations. The entire process ranged from September 2021 to June 2022, and I was passively preparing for interviews and applying to companies for FTE roles. I did not have any specific plans of getting into a specific company, and it was an [example of expanding my luck surface area](https://www.modelthinkers.com/mental-model/surface-area-of-luck), while applying to companies.

While my previous background and experiences really helped me in getting interviews with some of the companies, overall interviewing has a fair bit of randomness involved; you can always give your best and still fail through. Managing my expectations and making sure I don't take the opportunity as the be-all and end-all, and [focussing on the process not the result](https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-positive/ms-dhoni-process-is-more-important-than-the-result-m-s-dhoni-inspiring-video-good-morning-5882798/) (_one of my favorite quotes from my favorite cricket player, MS Dhoni, former Indian Captain_), is something that I would take back from this placement season.

So let's get started!

## Managing your expectations

It is important to make sure, that you have the clarity of what sort of career that you want to pursue. College is a good time to explore new things, and I had spent a fair bit of time in trying out various avenues of Computer Science, before settling down on Software Engineering, and specifically SRE. I didn't land up with these expectations overnight; you can spend fair amount of time in a field, by working on subject matter, contributing to Open Source, and practically trying out. The above exercise makes you aware of all the things that you don't want to pursue; having a deny list is much more easier task, than listing out the ones which you want to pursue.

Once you have a list of prospective roles/career paths that you would want to pursue, it is better to persist with the decisions/challenges for preparing for the interviews and all the nuances involved before getting that career.

For example, I had been actively involved with Software Engineering, and have been churning out code while contributing to OSS or working with a startup. The very exercise had made me very sure about my decision to pursue SWE as a career. One of the nuances that came with pursuing SWE, were the dreadful Algorithms and Data Structures interview. While the course itself is a fundamental aspect of Software Engineering, the standard of problems used in the interviews and the expectation from the candidates about the knowledge and problem solving skills, has rised to such a level, that it often deviates from the day to day application.

We certainly don't require [Inverting a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/) in the real job(unless your role is an Algorithmic Specialist xD), but the standard of problems require any applicants(including me) to me well versed with the game. So I had to gulp down my reservations about interviewing process, and prepare for the game. You would only be able to sustain the effort and passion, if you are passionnate/developed a likeliness towards the career that you would want to pursue.

Calibrate your expectations and have faith in the preparation process :100:

## Having a profile for niche roles

Niche roles are supposed to be specialised roles. You might be tempted
