This blog-post summarises my placement season, and my experiences ranging from prepping from interviews, to bagging some of the offers, and in-between managing my expectations. The entire process ranged from September 2021 to June 2022, and I was passively preparing for interviews and applying to companies for FTE roles. I did not have any specific plans of getting into a specific company, and it was an [example of expanding my luck surface area](https://www.modelthinkers.com/mental-model/surface-area-of-luck), while applying to companies.

While my previous background and experiences really helped me in getting interviews with some of the companies, overall interviewing has a fair bit of randomness involved; you can always give your best and still fail through. Managing my expectations and making sure I don't take the opportunity as the be-all and end-all, and [focussing on the process not the result](https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-positive/ms-dhoni-process-is-more-important-than-the-result-m-s-dhoni-inspiring-video-good-morning-5882798/) (_one of my favorite quotes from my favorite cricket player, MS Dhoni, former Indian Captain_), is something that I would take back from this placement season.

So let's get started!

## Managing your expectations

It is important to make sure, that you have the clarity of what sort of career that you want to pursue. College is a good time to explore new things, and I had spent a fair bit of time in trying out various avenues of Computer Science, before settling down on Software Engineering, and specifically SRE. I didn't land up with these expectations overnight; you can spend fair amount of time in a field, by working on subject matter, contributing to Open Source, and practically trying out. The above exercise makes you aware of all the things that you don't want to pursue; having a deny list is much more easier task, than listing out the ones which you want to pursue.

Once you have a list of prospective roles/career paths that you would want to pursue, it is better to persist with the decisions/challenges for preparing for the interviews and all the nuances involved before getting that career.

For example, I had been actively involved with Software Engineering, and have been churning out code while contributing to OSS or working with a startup. This very exercise had made me very sure about my decision to pursue SWE as a career. One of the nuances that came with pursuing SWE, were the dreadful Algorithms and Data Structures interview. While the course itself is a fundamental aspect of Software Engineering, the standard of problems used in the interviews and the expectation from the candidates about the knowledge and problem solving skills, has risen to such a level, that it often deviates from the day to day application.

We certainly don't require [Inverting a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/) in the real job(unless your role is an Algorithmic Specialist xD), but the standard of problems require any applicants(including me) to me well versed with the game. So I had to gulp down my reservations about interviewing process, and prepare for the game. You would only be able to sustain the effort and passion, if you are passionnate/developed a likeliness towards the career that you would want to pursue.

Calibrate your expectations and have faith in the preparation process ðŸ’¯!

## Having a profile for niche roles

Niche roles are supposed to be specialised roles. You might be tempted to apply for those fancy sounding roles, which might be a hit among the peer groups/social-media, due to the monetary benefits, work location, etc.

It is important to have some background knowledge/experience before applying for those roles. You might either see little people applying/many people applying, and it makes sense to evaluate the needs of the role you are applying, before spending time for prepping for the interviews.

For example, many of my college mates were quite excited about the Quantitative Researcher role in High Frequency Trading (HFTs), that pay almost 3-4 times the salary of SWEs. Obviously, without any context about the role, or the experience required, many of my friends had started prepping for the roles. One of my close friends had got into the QR roles with an early stage HFTs, which was quite an achievement, considering the pool of candidates with premium background they were interviewing before he landed up with the role.

Personally, I didn't feel much comfortable in applying for those roles, as I found myself lacking background while applying for such roles; it's totally fine if you want to explore and eventually, if you happen to like the role, then by all means, you should go ahead in pursuing that role. The same friend who landed the QR role, honestly didn't had much preference in pursuing SWE career, even though he had a solid experience in SWE. The moment you start diverging from your field of expertise and most importantly interest, then it becomes a soul-sucking job, which you would find very difficult to endure.


## Preparing your knowledge base about the subject matter

It is important to stand out from the crowd; nowadays, people prepare for the SWE roles, with little to almost no context about the job that they are planning to pursue. It is important to have prior knowledge about the roles, especially what is expected. This helps you to weed out roles, which you don't want to pursue. 

Having a good understanding of the technological stack and field of domain, already makes you stand out from your competitors. For example, while applying for roles which has algorithmic coding involved, it is important to showcase your skills and experience which highlights your prowess in that. Having a good Codeforces rating, or participation in ICPC, would certainly speak a lot about your calibre about Algorithmic thinking. It also helps the interviewers calibrate their interview according to your skills, and make sure they ask problems relevant to your experience.

In my case, I had a solid understanding in Python and working with monitoring systems. I had also made a chat application, which helped me visualise the basic challenges while making one. I would be elaborating more on how my previous experience helped me get ahead of the applicants.

## Prepping for SWE roles

There are multiple components for software engineering interviews. There might be some additional rounds of interviews testing Operating Systems, System Design, which I would be listing here -

### Algorithms and Data Structures

Preparing for Software Engineering interviews has one of the standard set of steps required. Resources like [LeetCode](leetcode.com) and [Grokking the System Design](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) are one of the standard resources for prepping up for the Algorithms/DS round. I would be writing up a seperate post on using leetcode while prepping up for interviews.

### System Design Rounds

System Design rounds kind of depend on companies.

* Typically FAANG companies don't have a System Design Round, where you are asked to design a software service. You can use the free resource [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer), which is really exhaustive about having a primer on the basics of System Design. Read this if you are interviewing for startups. In some of the FAANG interviews, you might just impress the interviewer if you know the basics of building systems.
* Startups generally have a mild System Design round, where they give you a standard System Design problem. You can start with basics, and the primer would help you to establish the fundamentals, before you deep dive on existing complex systems. No need to study esoteric systems, just make sure you understand the basics.

### Core Computer Science

There are some companies, mostly non-FAANG companies, like HFTs, good startups, they test your Computer Science fundamentals. Having a good understanding of Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Database and Management Systems is really core to your computer science understanding.

You can prepare for these topics in a month; you would need to spend 6 months - 1 year doing the assignments and courses. This makes sure that you have a solid understanding of the core concepts of CS. You can refer this blog - [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), it has one of the best list of resources for studying computer science in depth. If you follow the courses and solve the assignment, it would make you appreciate the basics of Computer Science like anything.

I personally used [OS in 3 easy pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), [Stanford Computer Networks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCMsyE1cvdWKsLVyf6cPwCLDIZnOj0NS) for studying Operating Systems and Computer Networks. I used my course lectures in [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/) for studying DBMS.

In case you are in a time crunch, I would advise buying an [Educative.io](educative.io) [standard plan](https://www.educative.io/unlimited) which might be a bit costly, but it is totally worth it. I had bought it for the following courses -
* Brushing Up Python - https://www.educative.io/path/python-for-programmers
* OS Virtualisation, Concurrency & Persistency - https://www.educative.io/courses/operating-systems-virtualization-concurrency-persistence/mEmm47O0g2n - I found reading the OS in 3 easy pieces much more comprehensive.
* Grokking the System Design Interview - https://www.educative.io/module/grokking-system-design-interview
* Grokking the Advanced System Design Interview- https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-adv-system-design-intvw
* C++ Basics and Concepts - https://www.educative.io/courses/cpp-programming-experienced-devs


## Applying for companies in Off Campus fashion

Applying for companies in off campus setup, is a bit harder than you would have in the campus setting. However, in countries like US, UK, etc. there doesn't exist a concept of campus placement; you have to fend for yourself. In such cases, it's imperative to apply to as much companies as you can find. Getting referrals is also one of the best way to get an interview. I have written in detail about applying to companies - [link](https://yashrsharma44.com/my-google-interview-experience/#how-did-i-manage-to-get-interviews)

Generally for FAANG companies, having a referral, applying at the time when the application portal opens, and keeping an eye on events which are recruitment events in disguise. You can also keep in touch with recruiters, as that is how I got my interviews with Meta.

For startups, make sure you apply on the careers page, and if possible, reach out to the founders. The founders are very much active in LinkedIn, and if you cold email/message, there is a high possibility that you would get a response from them.

I had written a detail post on applying to startups and working on one - [link](https://yashrsharma44.com/startup-over-a-year-i/#some-of-the-resources-for-finding-internship-consultation)


## My Interview Experience

Below is the list of the companies that I had been able to interview with fortunately. I had my fair share of rejections while applying to companies, so don't feel demotivated if you don't get the interview from your favorite company; keep applying until you get through  (:

### Platform.sh

[Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/) is PaaS solution, which takes your web application, and handles the scalability and reliability of the application. Often if you are hosting in AWS, there might be times where your application might be down, and you would have to manually fix them. Platform.sh takes away that problem, and lets you focus on the business logic.

#### Interview Experience

I had applied for the SRE role from their [careers page](https://platform.sh/company/careers/) and had shortly received the email for setting up 2 interview rounds. One of the rounds was based on cultural fit, and another was a deep dive in the OS and Python programming language. The cultural fit was a standard HR round, and the OS/Python Programming Language covered factual questions.

My understanding of [generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) in Python was one of the convincing point in the interviews. The interviewer was really impressed with my understanding of what is generators, how does the logical idea of a generator work, and how it was used for writing up [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)

I was asked about basics of Python, and he was also happy with my understanding of [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) which few people had been able to explain it convincingly.

I had been offered the 3rd interview with the hiring manager, but the timezone of working was declared a bit late, which was EMEA based. Since I was supposed to work remotely from India, it was certainly not a good fit for me. I had really liked the team and the company work, but alas, the timing just didn't work out for me, and I had declined the further set of interviews.


### Sysdig

[SysDig](https://sysdig.com/) is a service, which provides security solution for cloud applications running k8s, containers, etc. It was looking for an SRE to hire, and I had reached out to one of the engineers working with SysDig, for a referral. Fortunately, I was able to get the interviews, for the SRE role.

#### Interviews

I started the interviews with an HR round, discussing more about the role and the work the company does. It was more like an onboarding call to the interview process, which I personally liked a lot :D

I had 3 rounds further -
* DevOps and CI/CD Experience (Add Coderpad). Duration: 60 minutes.
  * This round was mostly about my experience with setting up CI/CD pipelines and my previous experience with setting up pipelines. Honestly, I did not have much idea about it, apart from using Github Actions, so I felt out of breath throughout the interview. I did try to explain about the different types of deployment process, and at the end of the interview, I quickly realised that they were looking for folks who have previous background as an SRE
* Kubernetes, Scaling, Collaboration. Duration: 45 minutes.
  * The entire interview went around using the k8s API for solving different aspects of containerization.
* Engineering & Architecture (Add Coderpad). Duration: 60 minutes.

Overall, the entire interview process was a disaster for me, as it certainly required a domain expert in SRE. Since I had a modest background in SRE, and I had done mostly Software Engineering before, it was difficult for me to relate to some of the questions. I quickly felt that startups with SRE role was something which I didn't had prior experience in. The interview process for SysDig was thorough; and some of the problems and interviewing process was quite aligned for folks who had some experience working as an SRE in other companies. I felt out of the water, and lack of domain knowledge which was expected was something, I never had a chance to build, because I was still in college while applying for the role.

### DevRev

[DevRev](https://devrev.ai/) is a platform which helps bring an integrated Slack, Github and JIRA experience into one. Till now, I still haven't been able to understand what the company does, though some of the features of the platform does make sense. Since it was backed by the co-founders of Nutanix and had a 50M $ seed funding, it meant that the company was doing something right and is on the right path.

The peer group was something which I was really excited about, as they had hired engineers from Facebook, Google and other companies. The founders themselves brought in a wealth of experience, and I was sure that this would be the company that would provide an experience of building products from 0 -> 1.

#### Interviews

I had applied to the [careers page](https://devrev.ai/join-us) and had gotten an Online Assessmment. It was 1.5 hours long, and I had to complete 4 algo/ds problems, and 15 MCQs based on Computer Science. The algo/ds problems were leetcode medium atmost, and I had completed the OA in an hour.

Once I completed the OA, I managed to clear this round, and had 5 interview rounds later -
* 2 Algo/DS
  * The Algo/DS round was a standard round as you would find in FAANG companies.
  * Each round had 3 problems, most of which were a direct ripoff from leetcode.
* 1 System Design
  * My interviewer was a Software Engineer, who had worked on the Facebook Messenger Application.
  * To make things interesting, I had listed a chat application as one of the projects that I had worked in. I was asked to explain the architecture, my tradeoffs and tech stack used. Since I had used gRPC instead of HTTP, I was asked to explain my choice. This was also accompanied with 2 coding problems.
* 1 Behavioral
  * I was asked to fill up a you.io form, which contains questions about your previous experiences and behavioural questions. All of them required you to speak from your experience, so I had poured my heart out while writing up the answers :D
  * There was a behavioural round, which had asked for standard questions
  * I was also asked - Why DevRev? What was the reason for chosing over a FAANG company?
* 1 Founders round
  * I was fortunate enough to talk with Manoj Agarwal, one of co-founders of DevRev.
  * We discussed numerous topics, ranging from campus placements to his experience of working with Nutanix
  * Overall it was one of the best founders round I had, which I still cherish

I was shared the serendipitious news of getting selected in the founders round itself, so I was quite happy and elated that after interviewing with 3 companies, I was finally able to nail one :D. On top of that, DevRev was one of the few companies, which I had genuinely wanted to work with, and start my startup journey.

### Cyble

[Cyble](https://cyble.com/) is a cyber security startup, which provides security solutions for all the software in the world. Think of it as one stop solution for collecting vulnerability and intel about prospective security issues.

I had applied for an internship role, which was converted as a PPO. I had reached out to the founder and the HR recruiter for a prospective internship role, which they were happy to share.

#### Interviews

I had 2 rounds of technical interviews, one of them was based on my resume and my experiences with working in Golang. They also asked some factual questions based in Golang, and I was asked to solve a couple of problem snippets.

The second round was taken by a senior engineer, who gave me a simple leetcode problem to start with, followed by a logical puzzle. I personally am not a fan of the puzzle, as it has no relation with the job whatsoever.

I was shortly shared the internship offer, as I performed well in the interview rounds.

After working with them for 4 months, I was shared a PPO to work with them full time, after completing my college.

### Neeva.com

[neeva.com](neeva.ai) is an upcoming startup, which provides privacy first search experience for documents. The company has been trying to provide Google Search experience, without tracking and personalised Ads for users, while charging them a small fee for the service. The interview process was fairly standard; leetcode rounds with problem solving for Algorithms and Data Structures. Most of the interviewers in the panel were ex-Google engineers, and had fair amount of experience working at Google Search product. 

#### Interviews

There was a take home exercise for the role, and it depended on the type of role one wanted to apply for. There were a bunch of assignments(take home exercise) based in Mobile Development / Backend Engineering / Frontend Engineering / Machine Learning roles. One had to implement the projects as it was listed and then submit the code to them, which would be evaluated and then processed forward.

I had my expertise in Backend Engineering, so I chose to solve the Backend Engineering assignment, which asked me to implement a "Tweet Searching" service, which would index all the tweets from a given dataset, and implement the API for searching through the tweets, which also contained "logical operators" for combining the search queries.

The project was really interesting, and I had implemented the same using Golang. I used Red-Black Trees for indexing the data, and it was an interesting deep-dive into optimising the time complexity of the API calls that were being made. I got a bit too excited with the problem statement, so I went ahead in proposing a solution, and then used profiling to solve the shortcomings of my approach. I used benchmarking to compare the results and verify my initial hypothesis for solving the problem. To be honest, it was using a nuclear saber to kill a fly, but I nevertheless shared my learnings, which I had found.

After the take home project, there were 3 coding rounds, and 1 behavioural round, which was a typical Algorithms/DS round for coding, and a call with the hiring manager for the behavioural round. There was one more round, where the platform to ask questions was reversed, and I was encouraged to ask questions about anything at Neeva/Google. As most of the core engineers were from Google, they were happy to share some of the experiences in Google and the challenges and exciting projects that were working at Neeva.

Overall, I found the problem space that they were working very interesting, and I genuinely wanted to work with them, due to the mentorship and greenfield projects that they were working. I wasn't able to have an offer for the FTE role, and unfortunately I didn't ask for any feedback from them. In the hindsight, I should have asked about my shortcomings/feedback, and it would have helped me in improving on them.


### Google EU (Ireland)

[Google](google.com/careers) requires no introduction; they have one of the best engineering cultures in the world, while solving plethora of problems, which are both unique and challenging in their own aspects. I had written a blog-post about it here - [link](https://yashrsharma44.com/my-google-interview-experience/).

### Facebook UK

[Facebook](facebook.com/careers) is one of the biggest social media platforms, which owns (as in Meta owns) WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Occulus. FB has one of the best engineering cultures that you can find, and it is one of the few companies which have bottom-up engineering culture. I have written a blog-post about my experience of applying for the Production Engineering role in Facebook UK, for the London office [link](TBC)
