This blog-post summarises my placement season, and my experiences ranging from prepping from interviews, to bagging some of the offers, and in-between managing my expectations. The entire process ranged from September 2021 to June 2022, and I was passively preparing for interviews and applying to companies for FTE roles. I did not have any specific plans of getting into a specific company, and it was an [example of expanding my luck surface area](https://www.modelthinkers.com/mental-model/surface-area-of-luck), while applying to companies.

While my previous background and experiences really helped me in getting interviews with some of the companies, overall interviewing has a fair bit of randomness involved; you can always give your best and still fail through. Managing my expectations and making sure I don't take the opportunity as the be-all and end-all, and [focussing on the process not the result](https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-positive/ms-dhoni-process-is-more-important-than-the-result-m-s-dhoni-inspiring-video-good-morning-5882798/) (_one of my favorite quotes from my favorite cricket player, MS Dhoni, former Indian Captain_), is something that I would take back from this placement season.

So let's get started!

## Managing your expectations

It is important to make sure, that you have the clarity of what sort of career that you want to pursue. College is a good time to explore new things, and I had spent a fair bit of time in trying out various avenues of Computer Science, before settling down on Software Engineering, and specifically SRE. I didn't land up with these expectations overnight; you can spend fair amount of time in a field, by working on subject matter, contributing to Open Source, and practically trying out. The above exercise makes you aware of all the things that you don't want to pursue; having a deny list is much more easier task, than listing out the ones which you want to pursue.

Once you have a list of prospective roles/career paths that you would want to pursue, it is better to persist with the decisions/challenges for preparing for the interviews and all the nuances involved before getting that career.

For example, I had been actively involved with Software Engineering, and have been churning out code while contributing to OSS or working with a startup. The very exercise had made me very sure about my decision to pursue SWE as a career. One of the nuances that came with pursuing SWE, were the dreadful Algorithms and Data Structures interview. While the course itself is a fundamental aspect of Software Engineering, the standard of problems used in the interviews and the expectation from the candidates about the knowledge and problem solving skills, has rised to such a level, that it often deviates from the day to day application.

We certainly don't require [Inverting a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/) in the real job(unless your role is an Algorithmic Specialist xD), but the standard of problems require any applicants(including me) to me well versed with the game. So I had to gulp down my reservations about interviewing process, and prepare for the game. You would only be able to sustain the effort and passion, if you are passionnate/developed a likeliness towards the career that you would want to pursue.

Calibrate your expectations and have faith in the preparation process ðŸ’¯!

## Having a profile for niche roles

Niche roles are supposed to be specialised roles. You might be tempted to apply for those fancy sounding roles, which might be a hit among the peer groups/social-media, due to the monetary benefits, work location, etc.

It is important to have some background knowledge/experience before applying for those roles. You might either see little people applying/many people applying, and it makes sense to evaluate the needs of the role you are applying, before spending time for prepping for the interviews.

For example, many of my college mates were quite excited about the Quantitative Researcher role in High Frequency Trading (HFTs), that pay almost 3-4 times the salary of SWEs. Obviously, without any context about the role, or the experience required, many of my friends had started prepping for the roles. One of my close friends had got into the QR roles with an early stage HFTs, which was quite an achievement, considering the pool of candidates with premium background they were interviewing before he landed up with the role.

Personally, I didn't feel much comfortable in applying for those roles, as I found myself lacking background while applying for such roles; it's totally fine if you want to explore and eventually, if you happen to like the role, then by all means, you should go ahead in pursuing that role. The same friend who landed the QR role, honestly didn't had much preference in pursuing SWE career, even though he had a solid experience in SWE. The moment you start diverging from your field of expertise and most importantly, interest, then it becomes a soul-sucking job, which you would find very difficult to endure.


## Preparing your knowledge base about the subject matter

It is important to stand out from the crowd; nowadays, people prepare for the SWE roles, with little to almost no context about the job that they are planning to pursue. It is one thing having less experience about the internal tools
