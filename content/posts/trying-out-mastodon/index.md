Notes:
* What is mastodon?
A variant of a social media platform
* similar to twitter, with toots
* hashtags for tagging posts
* emails - instead of a monopolistic entity, having multiple platforms which support different emails, and you could follow them accordingly. You can send/receive emails from different email-companies, and for you to open an account with a provider, you can do that as well.
* Home timeline, similar to how you have the same in Twitter; the feeds belong to the people you follow, posts that people you follow have boosted, and posts from hashtags that you follow.
* Federated Timeline, where folks from other server are sharing public status, and people are following them to get the content.
* Mastodon aspires to be a platform where people around should not spam each other with marketing targets, and instead get to know each other. I am personally circumspect about this, and maybe there might be a hidden gotcha that might be in play; having a platform where a social media interaction is free, means something must be paid in the entire lifecycle. 
* usernames hover around as @<USERNAME>@<INSTANCE>
* compared to a typical social media platform, each instance has their own set of rules/community guidelines. These are often enforced by a community member though.
* The reply chain is quite similar to Twitter;
