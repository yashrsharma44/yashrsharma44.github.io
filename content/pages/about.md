I am an undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur, pursuing Mathematics as my major. Coding remains one
of my hobby which I want to pursue full time later on. Apart from my love of coding, I am quite fond
of [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket).

I love to analyse the different aspects of cricket, and my craze has led me to imprint it as a part
of my coding identity. For those who are cricket enthusiasts, I have written a small [post](../to-be-or-not-to-be) explaining
how I came up with my programming alias - **yashrsharma44**.

## tl;dr

_Undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. Open Source Enthusiast._

### How is this blog made?

This blog is made through a static site generator called zola. This blog is Open Source and the code is available at [Github](https://github.com/xypnox/blag/).

### Special Thanks

Special thanks to [_**xypnox**_](https://www.xypnox.com/) for making this theme. I personally was quite fond of this
theme, and its minimalistic policy made it quite easy for curating blogposts and making changes, without fearing
of breaking things. _**xypnox**_ concisely summarises the need of another blog - [link](https://www.xypnox.com/blag/posts/migrating-to-zola/)
