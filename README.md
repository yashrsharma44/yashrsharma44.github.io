# Blog Repository of Me

_Blog repository containing all of my adventures and experience of Software Engineering and OSS_

![Deployment](https://github.com/xypnox/blag/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source for my blog hosted at [yashrsharma44.github.io/](https://yashrsharma44.github.io/).

The blog is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), A static site generator written in Rust. It uses a custom theme made specifically for this blog named `xyblag`, which can be found in the [themes/xyblag](https://github.com/xypnox/blag/tree/master/themes/xyblag) directory.

## Usage

`zola serve` to start a local server for live development, the deployment is done automatically through Github Actions.

The specific instructions for the theme are present in the [xyBlag theme's Readme](https://github.com/xypnox/blag/blob/master/themes/xyblag/README.md).

## Theme

## Credits

- The theme used the [Even theme](https://github.com/getzola/even) as a base and was modified into it's current form.
- This Blog is heavily inspired from [xypnox.com/blag](https://xypnox.com/blag).
